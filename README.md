### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Petr, I am open for new projects in IT as Java developer. My email - sumkin.gpb@gmail.com. 

I have been coding Java for about a year:

- Since July 2022 I have been studying at GeekBrains platform. 
- In November 2022 I obtained a diploma of SQL specialist by the Far-Eastern University in cooperation with stepik.org (I have e-certificates)
- I have completed most of the levels of the online course **[JavaRush / CodeGym](https://codegym.cc/)** and online internship, developing Java Enterprise Online Project (Maven/ Spring/ Security/ JPA(Hibernate)/ REST(Jackson)/ Bootstrap(CSS)/ jQuery). I have uploaded over 700 solved tasks (Java syntax, Java Core, collections, multithreading, streams, CRUD etc.) at [JRushTasks](https://github.com/Frenchfan/JRushTasks) repository.

Here are some of my projects:
- [Spring boot 3 + R2dbc Postgre (Reactive) + jwt + flyway](https://github.com/Frenchfan/jwt_postgres_webflux_flyway_base)  Quite a rare sample: flyway is used to create db structure as jpa is not available
- [Spring Framework Postgre + RabbitMQ event sourcing](https://github.com/Frenchfan/Java_geeksamples/commit/5bce2cefd05b4bc88151febdd775ba2fc8d480e4)
- [Spring boot + Spring Data project with Docker-compose configuration and DB scheme](https://github.com/Frenchfan/Titan/tree/master)
- [JDBC Postgre + RabbitMQ event sourcing + serialization ( Jackson(JSON, ByteArrayStream))](https://github.com/Frenchfan/Java_geeksamples/commit/9d4f0f8d83f2c9dbe6ea09fdb175374361003f81)
- [CSV parser to upload to PostgreSQL via JDBC (PreparedStatement), SQL injections](https://github.com/Frenchfan/Java_geeksamples/commit/d41ba61c2bf831b3080de52eac8cdcb7508cb667)
- [External sorting and upload via JDBC (PostgreSQL), PreparedStatement, bulk / batch insert](https://github.com/Frenchfan/Java_geeksamples/commit/23da81e362672b115cd80012b2eb1eae9d0d5fc0)
- [MVC Swing and Stream API (CRUD) - JTable with sorting options (Stream API) and control elements (checkBox, Button), MVC pattern](https://github.com/Frenchfan/Java_geeksamples/blob/main/src/main/java/OOPSem4/Homework4/Readme.md)
- [Unit tests (junit, hamcrest), Stream for sorting](https://github.com/Frenchfan/Java_geeksamples/blob/main/src/test/java/com/gridnine/testing/FlightsFilterTest.java)
- [Python](https://github.com/Frenchfan/Python_Examples)
- [C#](https://github.com/Frenchfan/C_Samples)
- [Spring Boot](https://github.com/Frenchfan/NeoStudyVacation/tree/master) and REST API

I adore working with data structuring and designing databases. Here is a sample db prepared for a commercial project:

P.S. I have a diploma in financial management by the Higher School of Economics (Moscow, 2013) and a master's degree in political science (2007) with professional command of English and French. I have over 12 years of experience working as a PR manager, international projects manager and head of PR and advertising department at various industrial companies.
