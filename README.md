### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Petr, I am open for new projects in IT as Java developer. My email - sumkin.gpb@gmail.com. 

I have been coding Java for about a year (as of February 2022):

- In July 2021, I finished the on-site course **"Java and Android applications"** at the educational center [Professional](https://eduprof.mos.ru/upload/programms/P34.pdf) under the government of Moscow
- I have completed most of the levels of the online course **[JavaRush / CodeGym](https://codegym.cc/)** and started the online internship, developing Java Enterprise Online Project (Maven/ Spring/ Security/ JPA(Hibernate)/ REST(Jackson)/ Bootstrap(CSS)/ jQuery) - to be completed in April 2022. I have uploaded over 700 solved tasks (Java syntax, Java Core, collections, multithreading, streams, CRUD etc.) at [JRushTasks](https://github.com/Frenchfan/JRushTasks) repository.
- In January 2022, I finished the "trainee" level at the **[job4j.ru](job4j.ru)**. This is an online Java-studying platform with over 2,500 students and 2,000 tasks. All of the tasks are reviewed by professional mentors, the course comprises oral exams. The "trainee" level includes basic syntax of Java, Git, Maven, Checkstyle, JaCoCo, jUnit, key design patterns, collections, lambda and stream. I have solved over 500 educational tasks. I am to continue the course to "junior" and "middle" levels going in depth with collections, multithreading, spring, servlets, SQL, JDBC, Hibernate (all these technologies I already know to some extent).

Most of the educational projects are available at my Github repositories with additional tests and comments, for example:

P.S. I have a diploma in financial management by the Higher School of Economics (Moscow, 2013) and a master's degree in political science (2007) with professional command of English and French. I have over 12 years of experience working as a PR manager, international projects manager and head of PR and advertising department at various industrial companies.
