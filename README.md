### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Petr, I live in Moscow and now I am open for new projects in IT as Java developer. 

I have been studying Java for about a year (as of February 2022):

- In July 2021, I finished the on-site course **"Java and Android applications"** at the educational center [Professional](https://eduprof.mos.ru/upload/programms/P34.pdf) under the government of Moscow
- I have completed most of the levels of the online course **[JavaRush / CodeGym](https://codegym.cc/)** and started the online internship, developing Java Enterprise Online Project (Maven/ Spring/ Security/ JPA(Hibernate)/ REST(Jackson)/ Bootstrap(CSS)/ jQuery) - to be completed in April 2022. I have uploaded over 700 solved tasks (Java syntax, Java Core, collections, multithreading, streams, CRUD etc.) at [JRushTasks](https://github.com/Frenchfan/JRushTasks) repository.
- In January 2022, I finished the "trainee" level at the **[job4j.ru](job4j.ru)**. This is an online Java-studying platform with over 2,500 students and 2,000 tasks. All of the tasks are reviewed by professional mentors, the course comprises oral exams. The "trainee" level includes basic syntax of Java, GIT, MAven, Checkstyle, JaCoCo, jUnit, key design patterns, collections, lambda and stream. I am to continue the course to "junior" and "middle" levels going in depth with collections, multithreading, spring, servlets, SQL, JDBC, Hibernate (all these technologies I already know to some extent).

Most of the educational projects are available at the repositories here with additional tests and comments, for example:

- eductional CRUD console application [Tracker](https://github.com/Frenchfan/job4j_tracker/tree/master/src/main/java/ru/job4j/tracker) to create, read, update and delete a list of items with additional time stamps and search methods
- [solution](https://github.com/Frenchfan/HH_Prog_School) of the algorithmical tasks for the Headhunter.ru programming school admission (fall 2021) 
- network chat [application](https://github.com/Frenchfan/edu_0759/tree/master/Gui_chat_0759) (gui interface javafx) 




I know, that I still need a lot to learn, however I feel ready to start working over commercial Java projects and open for full-time job proposals.
